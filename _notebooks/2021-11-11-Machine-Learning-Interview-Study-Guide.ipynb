    "    - It is a dimensionality reduction technique which summarizes a large set of correlated variables (basically a high dimensional data) into a smaller number of representative variables, called the principal components, that explains most of the variability in the original set.\n",
    "    - Preserves as much information as possible\n",
    "- When to use PCA?\n",
    "    - Do you want to reduce the number of variables, but aren’t able to identify variables to completely remove from consideration?\n",

    "    - Are you comfortable making your independent variables less interpretable?\n",
    "- Standardizing (mean 0 and variance 1) is important for PCA because it is looking for a new orthogonal basis where the origin stays the same, so having your data centered around the origin is good. The first principal component is the direction with the most variance, by scaling a certain feature with a weight of more than 1 will increase the variance on this axis and thus give more weight to this axis ([reference](https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/12299/how-can-give-weight-to-feature-before-pca))\n"

    "    - A learning rate that is too small leads to painfully slow convergence, while a learning rate that is too large can hinder convergence and cause the loss function to fluctuate around the minimum or even to diverge\n",
    "    - Learning rate schedules try to adjust the learning rate during training by e.g. annealing, i.e. reducing the learning rate according to a pre-defined schedule or when the change in objective between epochs falls below a threshold. These schedules and thresholds, however, have to be defined in advance and are thus unable to adapt to a dataset's characteristics\n",
    "    - Additionally, the same learning rate applies to all parameter updates. If our data is sparse and our features have very different frequencies, we might not want to update all of them to the same extent, but perform a larger update for rarely occurring features\n",

    "    - SGD has trouble navigating ravines, i.e. areas where the surface curves much more steeply in one dimension than in another\n",
    "    - Momentum is a method that helps accelerate SGD in the relevant direction and dampens oscillations. It does this by adding a fraction $\\gamma$ of the update vector of the past time step to the current update vector\n",
    "    - Think of momentum as pushing a ball down a hill. The ball accumulates momentum as it rolls downhill, becoming faster and faster on the way\n",
    "- Adagrad\n",
    "    - It adapts the learning rate to the parameters, performing smaller updates (i.e. low learning rates) for parameters associated with frequently occurring features, and larger updates (i.e. high learning rates) for parameters associated with infrequent features\n",
    "    - Strengths:\n",
    "        - Well-suited for sparse data\n",
    "        - Eliminates the need to manually tune the learning rate\n",
    "    - Weaknesses:\n",
    "        - Accumulation of the squared gradients in the denominator: since every added term is positive, the accumulated sum keeps growing during training. This in turn causes the learning rate to shrink and eventually become infinitesimally small, at which point the algorithm is no longer able to acquire additional knowledge\n",
    "- Adadelta\n",
    "    - An extension of Adagrad that seeks to reduce its aggressive, monotonically decreasing learning rate\n",
    "    - Instead of accumulating all past squared gradients, Adadelta restricts the window of accumulated past gradients to some fixed size $w$\n",

    "- Reduces training time\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dropout\n",
    "- During training, individual nodes are ignored with probability $1-p$ or kept with probability $p$\n",
    "- Dropout helps prevent overfitting due to a layer's \"over-reliance\" on a few of its inputs. Because these inputs aren't always present during training (i.e. they are dropped at random), the layer learns to use all of its inputs, improving generalization ([reference](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/374742/does-dropout-regularization-prevent-overfitting-due-to-too-many-iterations)) (a layer's \"over-reliance\" on a few of its inputs has the effect of co-dependency among neurons, i.e. neurons developing redundant representations of data for prediction)\n",
    "- A single model can be used to simulate having a large number of different network architectures by randomly dropping out nodes during training\n",
    "- There are several (related) explanations to why dropout works. It can be seen as a form of model averaging — at each step we “turn off” a part of the model and average the models we get. It also adds noise, which naturally has a regularizing effect. It also leads to more sparsity of the weights and essentially prevents co-adaptation of neurons in the network.

    "-  Vanishing gradient problem arises in cases where the gradient of the activation function is very small.

This makes the neural network to forget the long range dependency\n",

    "### Weight Initialization\n",
    "- If all the neurons have the same value of weights, each hidden unit will get exactly the same signal. While this might work during forward propagation, the derivative of the cost function during backward propagation would be the same every time.\n",
    "- In the 1-layer scenario, however, the cost function is convex (linear/sigmoid) and thus the weights will always converge to the optimal point, regardless of the initial value (convergence may be slower)\n",

    "- Unlike a regular Neural Network, the layers of a ConvNet have neurons arranged in 3 dimensions\n",
    "- Why are CNNs primarily used for computer vision tasks?\n",
    "    - The key lies in the convolution operation\n",
    "    - The primary purpose of Convolution in case of a CNNs is to extract features from the input image. Convolution preserves the spatial relationship between pixels by learning image features using small squares of input data.\n",
    "    - Less likely to overfit because CNNs typically have a lot more parameters\n",
    "- Filters\n",
    "- Pooling\n",
    "    - The result of using a pooling layer and creating down sampled or pooled feature maps is a summarized version of the features detected in the input. They are useful as small changes in the location of the feature in the input detected by the convolutional layer will result in a pooled feature map with the feature in the same location. This capability added by pooling is called the model’s invariance to local translation. ([reference](https://machinelearningmastery.com/pooling-layers-for-convolutional-neural-networks/))\n",
